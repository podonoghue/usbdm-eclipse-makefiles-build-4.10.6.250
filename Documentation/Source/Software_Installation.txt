 \section linuxInstallationSection Installation of USBDM for Linux
Under Linux, installation is done by a shell script that must be run a sudo root.  This is rather crude and if there is a
competent Linux expert available to update this feel welcome to step forward :) \n \n

  This will do the following:
  - Copy shared files to system directories
     - Shared libraries
  - Create a <b>.usbdm</b> directory in the user's root directory that is used for:
     - Programmer configurations
     - Device files (this will eventually move!)
  - Modify various other applications that USBDM is designed to work with.  These applications need to be installed <b>before</b> USBDM.\n
    <b>Note : </b> It may be necessary to re-install the USBDM software if Codewarrior is updated or re-installed as USBDM modified files may be replaced.
     - CW for MCU v10.1/v10.2/v10.3

 Various programs are then available in the installation directory.
  - Stand-alone programmers for various targets
     - Kinetis
     - Coldfire V1
     - Coldfire V2,3,4
     - MC56F80xx
     - HCS08
     - HCS12
     - RS08
  - Various utilities to support USBDM
     - BDM firmware updater
     - JS16 Bootloader
     - TCL interpreter
     - Coldfire V2,3,4 Unlocker
     - MC56F80xx Unlocker
     - JB16 Setboot utility
  - Documention and Examples
