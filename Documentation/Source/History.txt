          (not following access) (firmware) 
   -  V4.10.0 (September 2012) -
      - Added support for ARM-SWD interfaces (requires different hardware). \n 
        ARM-SWD is much faster than ARM-JTAG. For reference, programming a file
        to flash using Codewarrior 10.2:     \n
        \verbatim
                      Readback     Without 
                      verify       readback
        OSJTAG        1m 20s         53s
        USBDM-JTAG       47s         23s
        USBDM-SWD        21s         17s         \endverbatim
      - Improved ARM-JTAG interface speed.
      - ARM interfaces (JTAG & SWD) are now provided by USBDM interface DLL.  This means that the ARM API

         - Added check for disk file change and Auto Reload option.
         - Added Smart security option.
         - Deleted Prompt to cycle power option - This was being ignored in most cases anyway :)
         - Added Advanced option page etc.
         - Added several command line options corresponding to above.
      - More bug fixes
         - HCS08 programming in Codewarrior 10.1 may fail without warning
      - Extended reset & power options added to GDI & Programmers
   -  V4.9.3 (March 2012) -
      - More late bug fixes
      - Command line operation of stand-alone programmer results in disconnected process.
      - Added '-execute' option to above.
      - Fixed bug in Codewarrior 10.1 install, CW 10.1 & 10.2 may both be installed together.
   -  V4.9.2 (February 2012) -
      - More late bug fixes
      - Fixed alignment bug in HCS12 programmer for newer targets using PFlash.

      - Added programming algorithms for several HCS12 devices (HY,HA,XE,XS,P).
   -  V4.8 (December 2011) -
      - General update of how the programming algorithms are controlled.  \n
        They are much more configurable by the external XML and TCL files.  This allows for some customisation of the
        memory map on HCS12 devices or custom startup operations.  
      - Added Coldfire+ devices & algorithms.
      - Erase options extended (on some targets).
      - Re-testing of all devices (see list below) where complete memory images including paging were used.

      - Paging of Flash and EEPROM has been updated for HCS12 and HCS08 devices.  
      - The memory image descriptions are now more detailed and are more carefully enforced when programming.  Attempting
        to program non-existent memory is now reported before programming is attempted.  This should result in more 
        meaningful error messages.

   -  V4.3 (December 2010) -
      - Bug fixes (DSC Speed)
      - Improved Codewarrior V10 integration
      - Serial interface on JS16 versions (supported in JMxx but no example implementation)
   -  V4.0 (September 2010) - <b>Significant changes in some areas - Please read carefully</b>
      - Support for Linux (Eclipse version of Codewarrior only) \n
        Installation is still somewhat of a challenge!
      - Support for Linux and Windows7 64-bit (Eclipse version of Codewarrior only) \n
        To support the 64-bit version of Windows it has been necessary to update to using libusb-V1 drivers. For consistency
        this is also done on Linux.  As part of this process the VID/PID for the hardware (BDM) has been changed.  This will 
        allow the co-existence of Freescale's OSBDM-JM60 hardware while using a new driver for USBDM.  Formerly both these 
        BDMs used the same VID/PID and changes to the driver would not be possible.
      - Programming utilities for RS08, HCS08 and CFV1 are now (officially) included.
      - Support for MC56F800x (digital signal controllers) added. This is only available on USBDM_CF BDMs and the Axiom MC56F8006 Demoboard.
      - Minor bug fixes (installation script)
      - The addition of DSC support has pushed the firmware size to greater than 16K on the USBDM_JMxx-CF version.  This means that MC9S08JM32/60 chip must be used.
      - Changed to wxWidgets for common GUI code on Windows and Linux
   -  V3.0 (May 2010) - <b>Significant changes in some areas - Please read </b>
      - Support for Codewarrior V10 has been introduced.  This has required the development of specific GDI Dlls for each target type i.e.
        RS08, HCS08, CFV1 and CFV2-4.
      - The handling of RS08 devices has been further changed and now no RS08 derivative specific code is contained in the BDM firmware
        or USBDM.dll.  RS08 code is handled by the GDI layer for Codewarrior V10 or in the OpenSourceBDM.dll for the older version of
        Codewarrior.  This should mean that further devices may be added with no changes to either USBDM.dll or BDM Firmware.
      - Minor bug fixes in the BDM Firmware.
      - Added support for paged memory (-AC128, -DZ128 etc)
      - Changed trim algorithm to use linear curve fitting.
      - FTRIM now combined with existing image value if present.
      - Changed console handling on command line version.
      - Fixed "Image" security option modifying flash image. This could prevent programming the clock trim value by itself.
      - The calculated trim value is now available on the dialogue for use when debugging with a particular chip.
   -  V2.0 (September 2009) - <b>Major change - Please read </b>
      - Major revision.  The structure of the software has been revised and the operation with various 
        targets made more uniform.
      - Introduction of a new API for using the BDM.  Existing APIs (TBDML, OSBDM, TBLCF) are now 
        supported by a separate compatibility layer.  This has resulted in a very significant reduction
        in the complexity of both the BDM firmware and the interface DLLs.  The previous arrangement
        was becoming impossible to maintain. 
      - The handling of RS08 devices has been re-written in a more sensible fashion.  This involved moving the bulk of the RS08 code
        from the BDM firmware to the interface DLLs.  This should mean that additional devices can be introduced without changing the 
        BDM firmware.  Support for additional RS08 devices has been added.  The BDM now supports KA1, KA2, KA4, KA8, LA8 and LE4.
      - Because of the above changes, the BDM \b REQUIRES the use of the provided interface DLLs.  The
        BDM is no longer compatible with the original TBDML or OSBDM dlls.  \n The provided DLLs maintain some limited compatibility with
        earlier versions of TBDML, OSBDM and USBDM but may not support all features or targets
   -  V1.5 (June 2009)  <b>Initial USBDM-JMxx-CF release.</b>
      - Improved/corrected connection strategy for external power cycling
      - Minor bug fixed (glitch removal)
      - Improvements to ALT clock handling
      - Changes to USB code to fixed bugs with BDM being recognized on some PCs 
        (Thanks to Macias & Enrico for bug chasing and testing)
      - Minor changes to USB code - Tested with USBCV13.exe from USB.ORG - now passes 
   -  V1.4 (February 2009)
      - Fixed a bug in the USB code (unlikely to occur but worth fixing)
      - Added extra dialogues prompting the user to cycle target power when necessary.  Corresponding options added.
      - Added connection retry when target power is absent.
      - Added support for MC51AC256 (a bit of a hack!)
      - Modified HCS macros (to provide considerable size reduction as needed for USBDM_CF in 16K)
      - General clean up of code
   -  V1.3 (November 2008)
      - Unified Timer MACROS
      - Re-arrangement of Target Vdd control routines
      - Minor mods & corrected comments in bdm_syncMeasure()
      - Reviewed stack size
      - Increased cable_status.waitX size
   -  V1.2 (October 2008)
      - Removed library reference in ICP code - ICP broken when
        non-ICP code was changed!  This update requires the ICP code
        to be replaced when updating any code.        
      - Increased stack size (stack overflow was possible)
      - Utilities (setBoot) updated to match
      - Other cosmetic changes
   -  V1.1 (August 2008)
      - Vista compatibility
      - Fixed several bugs related to use of 1T45 buffers (Witztronics etc.)
   -  V1.0 (Dec 2009) Initial Release
      - Initial release.

\section sectionMaintenance Limitations & Maintenance
   - The devices supported are limited to those that I've had a chance to investigate.  The configuration for particular
     devices are contained in the various \b xxxx_devices.xml files.  This may be modified by hand to include other devices if
     they are similar to those already supported i.e. have a supported clock type and the usual type of Flash memory.\n
   - EEPROM (HCS12) and dual-flash (CFV1) are supported but not extensively tested.
   - The programmer \b requires the use of USBDM Ver 4.9 or later BDMs with <b>matching firmware</b>.  It should be possible to
     adapt the software to the OSBDM API relatively easily.
   - Note that Coldfire+ & Kinetis devices are limited to basic Flash programming and partitioning of FlexNVM.  Programming of 
     EEEPROM (simulated EEPROM) is not supported.  Any region of FlexNVM not allocated to EEEPROM backing store may ben programmed
     as conventional Flash.
       
 \section sectionKnownIssues Known Issues

   - Codewarrior Legacy
      -  Trim programming is not supported on older Codewarrior version.  It is only available in the Eclipse
         version and stand-alone programmers.  Trimming is done by Codewarrior not USBDM in the earlier 
         versions.  It is simply not implemented by Codewarrior (despite there being a nice dialogue box!).
         I can't do anything about this.  It is NOT a bug in USBDM.  
      
   - HCS12  
      -  The use of WAI or STOP instructions on HCS12 targets with the clocks disabled will cause the 
         BDM to lose connection.  There is no solution to this as it is a target BDM limitation.
      -  The use of WAI or STOP instructions on HCS12 targets with the clocks enabled will cause the 
         BDM target connection to become unreliable when the target is executing.  This will cause the
         debugger to occasionally update the screen incorrectly and to report that the target is 
         starting or stopping (in the status area).
         The screen will be correctly updated when the target is next halted so this is more of a cosmetic
         problem. 
      -  On early HCS12 targets (Version <4 BDM interfaces) there may be some minor problems with 
         single-stepping when using a clock multiplier.  The reason is unknown but I suspect it is a
         limitation of the Target BDM hardware.  Enabling the "Force BDM Clock Source" option and selecting 
         "Bus clock" prevents this problem but results in a very high frequency for the BDM interface.

   -  RS08
      - Programming is not supported on older Codewarrior version.  You must use the Eclipse version.

   - 568xx   
      - The Codewarrior 56800E Flash Programmer does not work with the USBDM GDI interface. I cannot find a reason for this but 
        since it doesn't work with OSBDM either I suspect that the GDI interface on the programmer is broken.\n
      - The support of MC56F80xx devices by the programmer is very limited since the devices differ significantly in their operation.  To
        add a device requires considerable work although this has improved somewhat recently.
      - MC56F80xx devices are NOT supported in the Codewarrior Eclipse version since this version uses extension to the GDI API that are 
        undocumented.  Some devices may be programmed but the debugging operation is limited as Flash based breakpoints are not properly 
        supported. 

   - Coldfire
      - The use of low power modes and STOP instructions has some issues on Coldfire V2, 3 & 4 targets.
         - Despite what the device manuals indicates it is not always possible to wake the target using
           the BKPT signal.  In some cases the only usable method is to reset the target. \n
           Because of this, it may be desirable to disable the automatic re-connect option as it may lead to 
           unintended resets when the BDM polls a sleeping target.  \n
         - A reset may still be done if the debugger tries to halt the target when sleeping (after unsuccessful 
           BKPT attempts).  This situation is reported to the user.\n
           The only guaranteed workaround for this problem it to use the RUN mode in the LPCR register although it
           should not be a real problem provided the target is not continuously sleeping i.e. it is being regularly
           woken by interrupts etc.
         - If not using the PST signals it may not be possible to differentiate between STOP (the target is sleeping
           but is considered to still be executing) and HALT (the target is suspended to allow debugging) states.  
           Because of this the debugger may incorrectly indicate that the target is halted when it is actually
           stopped (waiting for interrupts etc).  This also varies with the actual sleep mode selected. It is necessary to
           restart code execution and then halt the target to synchronise the debugger state if this occurs.\n
           There is no workaround for this problem as it is a limitation of the register polling method used in lieu
           of the PST signals.

   - Kinetis & Coldfire+
      - It is possible to program the these devices with an invalid program that will make it difficult to connect in debug mode.  
        This can be the case if the device is suffering from a reset trap or watch-dog timer failure.
        In these cases it is necessary to do a mass erase of the device to restore function.  Since it is difficult to identify this
        situation the programmers and Codewarrior interfaces may not do this automatically.
        If connection problems are encountered it may be necessary to use the mass erase option on the <b>stand-alone programmer</b>
        to erase the device.

   - Kinetis
      - If the flash has been protected (using FDPROT etc.) then it is necessary to use the Mass-erase option for programming.  I believe 
        this is due to a hardware bug in the devices. (FDPROT etc are NOT writable in debug mode.)  

 \section sectionCompatibility Compatibility
   -  The hardware is not compatible with existing TBDML, OSBDM or TBLCF \b hardware and \b requires the 
      use of custom driver DLLs.
   
 \section sectionTesting Testing
   The drivers and programmers have been tested with the following devices where supported by the particular programmer version
    (basic programming, debugging and clock trim where applicable):

   Please advise of any problems with particular chips.  

 \section hardwareErrata Hardware Errata
   - The previous version of the JM & JS BDMs used a 10M resistor for the crystal clock bias.  I have discovered that this 
     value is intended for lower frequency cystals.  A 1M resistor is recommended.  I have had no problems with boards using the 10M 
     value but there may be some issues with some crystals or chips.  I don't recommend changing the value in existing hardware unless
     there are problems.
