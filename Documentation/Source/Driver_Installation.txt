 \page driverPage USB Driver Installation

To support the 64-bit version of Windows it has been necessary to update to using libusb1.0 drivers. For 
consistency this is also done on Linux and the other windows platforms. As part of this process the 
Vendor-ID/Product-ID (VID/PID) for the hardware (BDM) has been changed. This will allow the co-existence of
 Freescale's OSBDM-JM60 hardware while using a new driver for USBDM. Formerly both these BDMs used the same
  VID/PID and changes to the driver would not be possible without rendering the OSBDM-JM60 inoperable. \n\n
<b>Note:</b> On Windows, libusb1.0 is a thin wrapper around the Microsoft winUSB low-level USB drivers.  Because
of this you may see references to winusb in the following.\n

 \section NoteOnFirmwareChange Note for upgrading from version 3.x to 4.x USBDM firmware
 
This change is complicated by the existence of a Bootloader in the BDM firmware.  If not replaced this
loader will continue to use the original VID/PID.  Because of this, it is desirable to completely replace the
BDM firmware. \n\n
For JS16 based BDMs this is a simple process since the Freescale JS12 Bootloader software may be 
used to replace all the firmware.  See \ref installationPage. \n\n
For JMxx based BDMs it is necessary to use a HCS08 programmer to re-program the entire device so that the 
Bootloader is updated when the rest of firmware is changed. If a programmer is not available then it is still
possible to update the BDM firmware <i>using the Bootloader</i> but the Bootloader will remain unchanged.  
To do this it will be necessary to install the drivers twice - once for the old VID/PID used by the Bootloader
and again for the new VID/PID used by the main firmware.  Doing so will render any OSBDM drivers inoperable 
on that USB port.

\section InstallingDriversSectionWindows Installation of USBDM USB drivers for Windows
  
The driver installation has been considerably simplified from version 4.10.3 by the provision of separate driver 
installers.  There are two installers provided - One for WIN-32-bit and separate one for WIN-64-bit systems.  
Please install the drivers before plugging in a BDM.  You may receive several prompts warning you that the 
drivers are not signed.  This is to be expected since I have not paid for them to be signed.\n
After installing the drivers, plugging in a BDM should trigger the actual driver installation. \n 
If you need to update the drivers it will be necessary to uninstall them from the Windows Add/Remove programs 
utility before installing the new version.

\section InstallingDriversSectionLinux Installation of USBDM USB drivers for Linux
There isn't any.  The installation script provided will modify the /etc/udev/rules.d file to allow
access to the USBDM device. The required driver for USBDM BDM interface (LibusbV1) is included in the standard
Linux (at least Ubuntu current version).  The CDC (serial port) is a standard device and should also be installed
without any extra steps.

If more installation is required on your version you will have to investigate this yourself.  I'm not a Linux 
expert and I don't have access to other versions for testing.  If you find other steps are necessary then please
 advise and I will try to update the installation accordingly.

 \section LinuxDrivers Linux Drivers
 The shell scripts supplied with the linux version should install the required information for the libusb drivers to work on a linux machine.
 
 You will also need to make sure you have installed some libraries:

  Hello PGO,
  
  I just tried your version 4.6 with Codewarrior 10.1 on a clean install of Ubuntu 11.04 (32 bit).
  In case it helps anyone else trying this, it required adding the following libraries with the Synaptic Package Manager:
    - tcl8.5 
    - libwxgtk2.8-0 
    - lbwxgtk2.8-dbg 
    - libstdc++5 
    - libxerces-c3.1
  Then it seems to run fine.
  Many thanks and best regards!
