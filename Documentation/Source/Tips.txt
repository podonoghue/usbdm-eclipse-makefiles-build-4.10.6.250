\section TroubleshootingSection1 Troubleshooting USBDM installation #1
   - <b>The USBDM option does not appear in the Codewarrior new project wizard</b> \n
      - The USBDM installation modifies the <i>new project wizard</i> files in the Codewarrior installation.  This may fail or 
         be undone by other changes such as the installation of Codewarrior updates.
   - <b>The USBDM launch configurations are missing.</b> \n
        This may cause the New Project Wizard to fail or make it impossible to launch debugging sessions with existing projects. 
        This problem may be confirmed by trying to open the launch settings for a project and checking for the USBDM options.  
      -  USBDM uses an eclipse plug-in to implement the USBDM launch setting dialogues.  If this plug-in is missing or failing to load the
         above issue will occur.\n\n 
   - Possible causes
      - The installation failed to complete successfully.  Files are missing or failed to be modified.
      - The changed files are overwritten by the installation of a Codewarrior service pack or upgrade.
      - Sometimes Codewarrior does not pick up plug-in changes initially.
      - On Windows 7, and depending on User Access Control (UAC) settings, the Codewarrior software may not be able to modify
        its own settings to recognise the USDBDM changes.  In particular, the plug-in may fail to load because of this.\n\n  
   - Resolution - Try the following in order
      -# The modification of the Codewarrior Wizard XML files is done as part of the installation process but is also available as a
        separate program in the USBDM menu.  This may be run manually if needed. (See <b><i>Start Menu->USBDM 4.x.x->/Codewarrior Wizard Patches</i></b>)
      -# <b>If using Windows 7,</b> try running Codewarrior in administrator mode.  This may allow eclipse to update its settings to 
        recognise the USBDM changes.  It should only be necessary to do this once.  To do this right-click on the Codewarrior icon and select
        <b>Run as administrator</b>.  You may be prompted for confirmation.
      -# Re-run the installation and choose <b>Repair</b> from the options.  This should check all files are present and re-run any USBDM
        patches to Codewarrior.
      -# Open a command prompt and run the following command: \n
        <b>"c:\Program Files\Freescale\CW MCU v10.0\eclipse\cwide.exe" -clean</b>\n
        This should be done as administrator under Windows 7.

\section TroubleshootingSection2 Troubleshooting USBDM installation #2
   - <b>BDM appears unreliable</b> \n
   - <b>Random messages about USB problems</b> \n
      - This may indicate a problem with the software versions.  It is very important that exactly the same version of software and BDM firmware is used.\n
      
   - Resolution
      -# Install the latest version of the USBDM software using the installer.
      -# Check for any late updates on the sourceforge website
      -# Update the BDM to the firmware version supplied with the software.  \n
        This is done with the provided <b>USBDM Bootloader</b>.  
        The required files are present in the USBDM installation directory created at step a). \n
        Please see \ref sectionUpdate for details.

\section TestingTheBDMHardwareSection Testing the BDM hardware
      
   There is TCL command interpreter supplied with the later version of usbdm.  In V4.7 onwards this is available in the start menu as <b>USBDM TCL Interpreter</b>. \n
   Type ? to get a list of commands.\n\n
   
   You can do a basic output pin static test with the following commands:
\verbatim
;# Simple BDM test 
openbdm
settarget hcs12

pinSet rst=L    ;# Reset pin should be low
pinSet rst=3    ;# Reset pin should be 3-state and weakly pulled-up by a resistor to target VDD on the BDM.
pinSet bkgd=L   ;# BKGD pin should be low
pinSet bkgd=3   ;# BKGD pin should be 3-state and weakly pulled-up by a resistor to target VDD on the BDM.
pinSet bkgd=H   ;# BKGD pin should be high
\endverbatim
   
   If you are using an unpowered BDM you would need to supply power to the BDM connector for this to visibly affect the pins.\n
   These tests should be done without a target connected.\n\n

   The following provides a repeating loop for testing with a CRO:

\verbatim
;# Simple BDM test loop for HCS12/08 interface pins
openbdm
settarget hcs12

proc test {} {
   for { set i 1 } { $i <= 100 } { incr i } {
     pinSet rst=L  ; after 10;
     pinSet rst=3  ; after 10;
     pinSet bkgd=L ; after 10;
     pinSet bkgd=3 ; after 10;
     pinSet bkgd=H ; after 10;
     pinSet bkgd=3 ; after 10;
   }
}
\endverbatim

You can type this in directly or more conveniently save the above script it to a plain text file (say testbdm.tcl) in the same directory as the USBDM files.\n
You can then load the script and execute the test procedure using the following commands:

\verbatim
source testbdm.tcl
test
\endverbatim

 \section addingTargets Adding Missing Targets to Codewarrior V6(HCS08/CFV1) or V5.1(HCS12)
 
    <b>Note: The above Installation process now modifies the Legacy Codewarrior installations to incorporate
    the changes described in the second alternative below. </b>

   USBDM 'pretends' to be a OSBDM or a TBDML for Legacy Codewarrior versions.  Unfortunately OSBDM and TBDML 
   (and hence USBDM) are no longer supported by Freescale for newer targets including some HCS12, HCS08 and 
   Coldfire V1 devices.  It is still possible to use USBDM (or OSBDM) but it requires some 'messing about' 
   to either set up a target or to modify the Codewarrior configuration to make TBDML/OSBDM/USBDM available as a connection.
   
   If you find that the required connection is not available for the target you are using you can do <b>either</b>
   of the following:
  
  <hr> 
   For each project that you create do the following steps:
   <ul>
    <li> Set up a project for one of the other debug connections (e.g. CFV1 FSL ...)</li>
    <li> Start the debugger - the debugger will be unable to find the missing interface. Just cancel the dialogues but stay in the debugger.</li>
    <li> Within the debugger select <B>Component->Set Connection...</b> and select <b>HCS08/CFV1 Open Source BDM</b>.</li> 
    <li> Exit the debugger</li>
    <li> Restart the debugger from the IDE.  You should find that it is now using the OSBDM/USBDM connection.
      This should persist unless you change the connection within the IDE in which case you will need to re-do the above steps.</li>
      </ul>
   I have only tried this (recently) with a CN128 but it should work for other targets.
   This has not been tested very much so there may be other problems.

  <hr> 
   Modify the Codewarrior configuration so that the OSBDM/USBDM connection is available in the Project Wizards.
   <ul>
    <li> Edit the target specific file for the device you are using e.g.\n
    "C:\Program Files\Freescale\CodeWarrior for Microcontrollers V6.3\bin\plugins\Support\HC(S)08Wizard\XML\MCF51AC256A.xml"</li>\n
    "C:\Program Files\Freescale\CWS12v5.1\bin\Plugins\Support\HC12Wizard\XML\mc9s12xf128.xml"
    <li>Add the following clause amongst the other similar looking ones :)</li>
    </ul>
    For \b HCS08
   \verbatim
   <RESTRICTION>
      <WIZARDELEMENTREF idref="ID_CONNECTION_LIST">
         <RECURSION nameref="" idrefs="ID_CONNECTION_LIST ID_CONN_HCS08OSBDM"></RECURSION>
      </WIZARDELEMENTREF>
   </RESTRICTION>
   \endverbatim
    For \b CFV1
   \verbatim
   <RESTRICTION>
      <WIZARDELEMENTREF idref="ID_CONNECTION_LIST">
         <RECURSION nameref="" idrefs="ID_CONNECTION_LIST ID_CONN_CFV1OSBDM"></RECURSION>
      </WIZARDELEMENTREF>
   </RESTRICTION>
   \endverbatim
    For \b HCS12
   \verbatim
   <RESTRICTION>
      <WIZARDELEMENTREF idref="ID_CONNECTION_LIST">
         <RECURSION nameref="" idrefs="ID_CONNECTION_LIST ID_CONN_TBDML"></RECURSION>
      </WIZARDELEMENTREF>
   </RESTRICTION>
   \endverbatim
   <b> The above has had only trivial testing so YMMV </b>
