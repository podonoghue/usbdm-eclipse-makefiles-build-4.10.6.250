This page provides brief instructions on how to create a C or C++ project for a Coldfire or Kinetis
target using Eclipse and Codesourcery Lite tools.  

It assumes that the required software has been installed \ref codeSourceryInstallPage
   
\section creatingEclipseProject Creating an Eclipse Cross-Compiler Project with USBDM
The following example is for a Coldfire target but a similar process is followed for a Kinetis device.\n

         	- Select the Build Tools being used (choice only for Kinetis devices)
            - Select the device to be used.  
         - Linker Parameters
            - Auto-generate linker script - The USBDM Wizard will automatically create a linker script based upon the device's
              memory map.  The linker script is designed to work with the startup files provided by the Wizard.
            - Linker Script is used to use a pre-existing linker script instead of automatically generating one.  Codesourcery
              provides various linker scripts that may be used.  This linker script will be <b>copied</b> into the project 
              directory.

         These values are used to update system-level settings and affect all existing and new projects.  It is usually
         only necessary to set these value once for Eclipse.\n
         These values may also be accessed from the USBDM menu.
         - ARM Ltd GNU Tools
         - Codesourcery Tools for ARM
         - Codesourcery Tools for Coldfire
	         - The Eclipse tools need to know the target-specific tool prefix.\n
	           The prefix <b>m68k-elf-</b> is usual for M68K (Coldfire etc) targets.\n
	           The prefix <b>arm-eabi-</b> is usual for ARM targets.\n
	         - Eclipse needs to know where to find the GCC Tools.  
	         These two options can be conveniently set by using the Browse Button to browse to the 
	         installation location of the XXXXXgcc.exe program included with the tools e.g. arm-eabi-gcc.exe.\n
	         If a particular toolchain is not being used then the entries should be cleared.  
         - Make command \n
	        Under windows it is necessary to provide a GNU make tool to use in project builds.  
	        USBDM includes a copy of the GNU make utility renamed as usbdm-make.  This is a convenient choice.
         - Rm (delete) command \n
	        Under windows it is necessary to provide a usable delete command to use in project builds.  
	        USBDM includes a copy of the GNU rm utility renamed as usbdm-rm.  This is a convenient choice.

         The Wizard will create a basic project with a brief demonstration mainline.\n
         It should now be possible to build the project using the menu item <b>Project->Build All</b>\n
         Expanding the project will display the project contents as shown:
         - Project_Headers
            - derivative.h - for convenience.  Just includes the target-specific header file.
            - MCF51CN128 - Target specific header file.  This is a just a place holder.\n
              Freescale provide various header files for their devices.  However it would not
              be legal to distribute these with USBDM.\n
              It is possible to add header files to the USBDM installation.  Refer to the header file 
              provided for instructions.
         - Source
            - This the main source folder.  At the moment it contains only the example main.cpp\n
              This program is a simple demo.  It includes an example of implementing an interrupt handler that
              will work with the provided vector table (see below).
         - Startup_Code
            - The Codesourcery software assumes certain startup actions to support the C library.  The target
              processor also may require some low-level initialization.  These file provide generic examples
              that may be modified for a particular target.  They have been tested with a few devices but are
              unlikely to be suitable for every target.\n
              It also contain a file describing a generic vector table for the device with default handler. \n
              These are based on the Codesourcery documentation or provided examples.
         - Debug
            - This directory contains the compiled files for the Debug target.  These are created by the 
              Build operation.
         - Project_Settings
            - The folder contains the target linker files either generated or copied into the project.  It also
              contains a default launch configuration for the <b>Debug</b> target for use with the USBDM debugger.

- You may now build the project by clicking on the hammer icon.

\section launchConfigurationColdfire Launch Configuration Settings
The following describes important dialogues and settings in the launch configuration that will have been created
by the USBDM Wizard.\n 

- Select <b>Run->Debug Configurations</b> from the menu.

\image html DebugConfiguationBare.png

- Locate the launch configuration corresponding to the project just created.  This will be under USBDM Hardware
 Debugging item in the left-hand panel.
  
- <b>Debugger Tab</b> in the dialogue.\n
    - USBDM Parameters
      - Interface - This indicates the target-specific USBDM debugging interface being used.
      - Target Device - Indicates the device being debugged.
      - Debug - Select the debug version of the USBDM Sprite.  Used for testing USBDM.
    - GDB Setup
       - Build tool: - Select the build tool being used.  This controls the next two options.  If a build tools 
         is selected the next two options will be automatically set.   
	       - GDB Command: - The GDB command to be used.
	       - GDB Bin Path: - Where to look for the above command. 
       - Command Set - Standard 
       - Protocol Version mi
       - Verbose console mode - selecting this will generate messages indicating the GDB communication.

\image html DebuggerTabKinetis.png

- Startup Tab\n
  <b>Startup Tab</b> in the dialogue. Check the following settings:
    - Initialization Commands
       - Reset and Delay - Not used (Not supported by USBDM interface)
       - Halt -  Not used (Not supported by USBDM interface)
       - (Empty box - This is a list of initial commands) - Not used
    - Load Image and Symbols
       - Selected to <i>load image</i> from the project binary since the USBDM GDB server supports target 
         programming.  Alternatively, the target can be programmed beforehand.
       - Select to <i>load symbols</i> from the project binary as well.
    - Runtime Options
       - <i>Sets a breakpoint</i> at main()and to <i>resume</i> execution.  This will cause the debugger 
         session to stop at the first line of the main() routine when debugging is started. \n

\section debugging Debugging

- You can now start a debugging session using the launch configuration above. \n
  You should find that the follow steps occurring:
   - Session starts
   - The program is down-loaded to the target
   - Execution commences at the program entry point
   - Execution stops at the first line of main()
   
   You should be able to debug in the usual fashion with breakpoints, single-stepping etc.
